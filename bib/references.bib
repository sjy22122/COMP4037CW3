abstract = {We present a research-through-design exploration of transforming large-scale public illustrations into interactive media. We collaborated with creative practitioners to extend an existing visual marker technology to support spatial and layered interaction with wall-sized images. We document how these techniques were used to design interactive illustrations and how visitors to an exhibition engaged with these. We conclude that it is feasible to combine spatial and layered interactions to attach complex narratives to public illustrations, and highlight challenges around instruction giving, sociality and repeat experiences.},

abstract = {As locative media and augmented reality spread into the everyday world so it becomes important to create aesthetic visual markers at scale. We explore a designer-centred approach in which skilled designers handcraft seed designs that are automatically recombined to create many markers as subtle variants of a common theme. First, we extend the d-touch topological approach to creating visual markers that has previously been shown to support creative design with two new techniques: area order codes and visual checksums. We then show how the topological structure of such markers provides the basis for recombining designs to generate many variations. We demonstrate our approach through the creation of beautiful, personalized and interactive wallpaper. We reflect on how technologies must enable designers to balance goals of scalability, aesthetics and reliability in creating beautiful interactive decoration.},

abstract = {Advances in display and tracking technologies hold the promise of increasingly immersive augmented-reality experiences. Unfortunately, the on-demand generation of haptic experiences is lagging behind these advances in other feedback channels. We present Annexing Reality; a system that opportunistically annexes physical objects from a user's current physical environment to provide the best-available haptic sensation for virtual objects. It allows content creators to a priori specify haptic experiences that adapt to the user's current setting. The system continuously scans user's surrounding, selects physical objects that are similar to given virtual objects, and overlays the virtual models on to selected physical ones reducing the visual-haptic mismatch. We describe the developer's experience with the Annexing Reality system and the techniques utilized in realizing it. We also present results of a developer study that validates the usability and utility of our method of defining haptic experiences.},

abstract = {This paper shows how generic proxies as tangible interfaces can provide an intuitive and realistic interaction method to manipulate artefacts in AR. The domain we selected was cultural heritage, specifically the interaction with historical artefacts. We explored four interfaces: 1) a standard touch screen using a web 3D viewer, 2) a traditional flat AR marker, 3) a generic wooden cylinder, and 4) a 3D-printed replica of the digital artefact. Our results show that a 3D-printed replica represents the most realistic interaction method to manipulate artefacts in AR. However, we further found that using a generic object such as the cylinder can deliver a more immersive experience, offering an advantage over the standard touch screen and flat AR marker. As high-fidelity physical objects can be costly to produce. We argue that a more generic physical proxy is a feasible middle ground when 3D-printed replicas are not viable. We then discuss design opportunities for using generic objects to explore different artefacts in AR.},

Given that user experience plays a significant role in the success of new technologies, the development of appropriate AR user interfaces needed. As such, defining the challenges to current AR user interfaces is a steppingstone to enhancing user experience. There are three principal components of interaction in AR systems: the user, the user interface and the virtual content. Examples from the literature are provided to identify the challenges to each interaction component. Both the layout of the AR interaction component and the identified challenges aim to help and inform researchers and AR software developers to choose the AR interaction aspects that best serves their purpose, while also contributing to the enhancement of user experience.},

In this proposal, we divide the concept of virtual shadow into four categories, and among them, implement four types of interactive applications: (a) real to virtual shadows for rigid objects; (b) real to virtual shadows for non-rigid objects; (c) image-based virtual to virtual shadows, and (d) virtual to real shadows. In these applications, we can see the shadow of a real object projected onto the virtual world and vice versa. These proposed concepts should contribute to the realization of a mixed reality environment that provides a novel sense of interaction.},

In this paper we explore the application of visual makers that can be designed to be meaningful and that can be created by visitors themselves. We study both the use of these markers as labels for portraits that link to audio recordings and as a mechanism for visitors to contribute their own reflections to the exhibition by drawing a marker and linking an audio comment. Our findings show visitors appreciated the use of the aesthetic markers and engaged with them at three levels -- physical placement, aesthetic content and digital content. We suggest that these different levels need to be considered in the design of future visiting systems, which make use of such markers, to ensure they are mutually supporting in shaping the experience.},

abstract = {A seamless connection between a game space and the real world is a long-sought goal of the entertainment computing field. Recent games have intuitive interactions through gestures and motion-based control. However, their images are still confined to the displays. In this paper, we propose a novel interaction experience in which mid-air images interact with physical objects. Our “Mid-air Augmented Reality Interaction with Objects” (MARIO) system enables images to be displayed in 3D spaces beyond screens. By creating a spatial link between images appearing in mid-air and physical objects, we extend video games into the real world. For entertainment purposes, a game character appears in mid-air and jumps over real blocks that users have arranged with their hands. A user study was conducted at public exhibitions, and the results showed the popularity and effectiveness of the system as an entertainment application.}
